                <p>Welcome to Save the Flower game. You are required to save the Flower which you will see in the game page. You should save it by guessing the correct word with the given hint.
                    You will have 6 chances in total to find a word that is there will be six petals to the Flower. If you guess one wrong letter you will lose one chance, your flower will lose one petal. 
                    Likewise it will go until five petal. But remember if you lose the sixth petal you will lose your flower and game will be over. And that's it you might have 
                    grabbed the concept. Now you are required to Save the Flower. All the Best.
